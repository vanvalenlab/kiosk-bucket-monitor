The `StaleFileBucketMonitor` is used to remove files from the DeepCell Kiosk cloud storage bucket. This helps to save costs by preventing files from being stored in the bucket indefinitely.

This repository is part of the [DeepCell Kiosk](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-console). More information about the Kiosk project is available through [Read the Docs](https://deepcell-kiosk.readthedocs.io/en/master) and our [FAQ](http://www.deepcell.org/faq) page.
