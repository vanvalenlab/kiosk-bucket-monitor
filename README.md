The `kiosk-bucket-monitor` (and more specifically the `StaleFileBucketMonitor`) is used to remove files from the DeepCell Kiosk cloud storage bucket. It is intended as a cost-saving mechanism that prevents files from being stored in the bucket indefinitely.

This repository is part of the [DeepCell Kiosk](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-console). More information about the Kiosk project is available through [Read the Docs](https://deepcell-kiosk.readthedocs.io/en/master) and our [FAQ](http://www.deepcell.org/faq) page.
